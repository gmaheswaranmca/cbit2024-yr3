Q: **Invert Binary Tree (LeetCode 226)**
https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

**Problem:** Invert a binary tree.
- **Solution:** 
    Swap the left and right children of each node in the tree.


### Problem Explanation:
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Solution Approach:
We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. 
For each node, 
    we swap its left and right children, and | visit node 
    then recursively invert                 
        the left and right subtrees.         | travel left 
                                             | travel right 

We try to use preorder traversal for this problem.
psedo code: 
    if not root:
        return None
    1. visit node: swap the children 
    2. travel left 
    3. travel right 
    return root
