Q: **Path Sum (LeetCode 112)**
    https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/
   - **Problem:** 
        Given a binary tree and a sum, 
        determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path 
        such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
   - **Solution:** 
        Use DFS to check each path's sum from the root to the leaves.

### Problem Explanation:
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer target sum, 
determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path 
such that the sum of the node values along the path equals the target sum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

### Solution Approach:
We can solve this problem 
    using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach. 
For each node, subtract the node's value from the target sum, 
and recursively check its left and right subtrees with the updated sum. 
If we reach a leaf node and the remaining sum equals the leaf's value, 
we have found a valid path.
