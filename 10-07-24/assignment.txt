Q:
Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/

Explanation:
- The solution converts 
    a sorted array 
    into 
    a height-balanced BST.
- It finds the middle element of the array to use as the root, 
    then recursively constructs 
        the left 
            and 
        right subtrees 
            using 
                the left 
                    and 
                right halves of the array.
