Q: **Same Tree (LeetCode 100)**
    https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/
   - **Problem:** 
        Given two binary trees, 
        write a function to check 
        if they are the same or not.
   - **Solution:** 
        Compare each node in both trees 
        to see if they have the same structure and values.
 


### Problem Explanation:
Given the roots of two binary trees, 
determine if they are the same or not. 
The trees are the same 
    if they have the same structure and 
    every corresponding node has the same value.

### Solution Approach:
We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. 
For each pair of nodes from both trees, we need to check:
1. If both nodes are `None`, they are considered the same.
2. If only one of the nodes is `None`, the trees are not the same.
3. If the values of the nodes are different, the trees are not the same.
4. Recursively check the left and right subtrees of both nodes.
