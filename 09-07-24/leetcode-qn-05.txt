Q: **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (LeetCode 104)**
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

- **Problem:** Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
- **Solution:** Use a depth-first search (DFS) or 
        breadth-first search (BFS) 
        to traverse the tree and keep track of the maximum depth encountered.
        
The "Maximum Depth of Binary Tree" problem on LeetCode 
requires finding the maximum depth of a given binary tree. 

        "   The depth of a binary tree is 
            the number of nodes along the longest path 
            from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.  "

### Problem Explanation:
    - The depth of an empty tree is 0.
    - For a non-empty tree, the maximum depth is 
        the maximum depth of its left or right subtree 
            plus 
        one for the root node.

### Solution Approach:
    We'll use a recursive approach to solve this problem. 
    For each node, we calculate the maximum depth of its left subtree and 
    right subtree and return the greater of the two, plus one 
    (to account for the current node).
